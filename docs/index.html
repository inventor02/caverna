    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Caverna is a rogue-like game written in C, using OpenGL for graphics. It's currently in development.</p>

    <h2>Project Team</h2>
    <p>
      Caverna is developed by four students in <a href="https://ecs.soton.ac.uk">ECS at the University of Southampton</a> -
      George Peppard, Toby Godfrey, Adam Caine and Ellie Heywood ({gjp1g21, tmag1g21, ac3g21, ejh3g21}[at]soton.ac.uk). We're
      working on this project because we have some (not much!) spare time and wanted a fairly long-term project to work on
      in between lectures.
    </p>

    <h2>Documentation and Issue Tracking</h2>

    <p>
      We use Atlassian Jira for issue tracking and document code style and other information for both contributors and
      users on Atlassian Confluence. Links to both of these platforms are available at the top of the page and anyone
      may register for an account.
    </p>

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>
      Caverna is open source and we welcome contributions. You can find us on GitHub using the links at the top of the page. Please take
      some time to read the documentation before contributing. The project is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/inventor02/caverna/blob/main/LICENSE">
      GNU General Public License 3.0</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Releases</h2>
    <p>
      Caverna is not currently available for release. We will update this page when working builds are available.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
